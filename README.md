## Introduction

Based on the design by [PsyToolkit](https://www.psytoolkit.org), a free platform for online psychological research and information, the Corsi block-tapping test is a short-term memory task. Named after the author [Philip Michael Corsi](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741s554), this task was not initially designed to be carried out as a computer task.
